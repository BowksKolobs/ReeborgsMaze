Reeborg's World allows users to write code to solve some of the puzzles and challenges on the game.
You can write and test your code to see if Reeborg (Robot displayed on the Graphical User Interface) does what you intend for it to do.
You can visit this game on the URL on line 4.

This particular Python code solves the 'Maze' challenge.
The aim of the challenge is to write a code which gets Reeborg to the finish line regardless of the maze. The maze changes everytime you press play.
Enjoy :)
